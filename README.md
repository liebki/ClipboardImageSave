# ClipboardImageSaver

### Description
Easily save an image that is in your clipboard to a file, with a click.

### Why does this exist?
I often screenshot things when I'm learning or when I document something. 
Every time, I had to use some double/triple way around to save this file from my clipboard to an actual file. 
Now I just click on ClipboardImageSave, and the file will be saved with a random name.
## Roadmap

- Hotkey-Feature or detection if image is in clipboard, then save and empty clipboard
- Updater (GitHub check)
