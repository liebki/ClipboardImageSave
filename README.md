# ClipboardImageSaver
##### Easily save a image that is in your clipboard to a file, with a double-click.

###### Why does ClipboardImageSaver exist?
I often screenshot things when I'm learning at my computer or when I document something.
Every time, I had to use some double/triple way around to save this file from my clipboard to an actual file.
Now I can double-click ClipboardImageSave.exe, and it saves the file with a random name (based on DateTime.Now.Ticks).

Eventually I add some hotkey feature, or I do it so that the program is running in the background, checking for an image file to appear in the clipboard.
